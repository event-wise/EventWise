# EventWise

This repository is created to collect all documents and codes of the EventWise application in one place. 

#### Project Description

Mobile phones are one of the most essential tools in the contemporary world and they have become an integral part of people’s life. This integration has come with lots of benefits but it is not deniable that there are some drawbacks. One of these drawbacks is that people are becoming increasingly introverted thanks to having lots of alone time entertained thanks to mobile phones. Thus, if a person has a phone inside their palm, they do not feel to urge to socialize. Therefore, there is a need to build a platform that brings friend groups or crowds together by making them eager to organize events and socialize.

In this application, there are groups consisting of friends. Anybody can create a new group then, everyone in this group can create an event and invite any other person in the group.  In any group, the person can create or attend an event and socialize. All the activities of all members are logged into the log tab of the group. The logs depict information about the creator of the event, who accepted or did not accept the invitation to a particular event.
